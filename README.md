**üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project**

This project demonstrates SQL techniques used for analyzing retail sales data. It involves setting up a database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering key business questions through SQL queries.


**üéØ Objectives**

**üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup:** Create and populate a retail sales database.

**üßπ Data Cleaning:** Identify and remove records with missing values.

**üìä Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gain insights by exploring the dataset.

**üí° Business Analysis:** Use SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.

**üìå Project Structure**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,    
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,    
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,    
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Cleaning

**üîç Basic Data Exploration**

```sql
-- üìä Total records in dataset
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

-- üî¢ Count of unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;

-- üè∑Ô∏è Unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```

**üßº Null Value Check & Data Cleaning**

```sql
-- ‚ùì Checking for NULL values
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- üóëÔ∏è Removing records with NULL values
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & Insights


**üìä Key Business Questions Answered Using SQL**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales on a Specific Date ('2022-11-05')**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clothing Sales (Quantity > 4) in November 2022**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30'
AND quantity >= 4;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Total Sales by Product Category**

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Age of Customers Purchasing from 'Beauty' Category**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age FROM retail_sales WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Value Transactions (Total Sale > 1000)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Transactions by Gender in Each Category**

```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
```

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Best-Selling Month Each Year**

```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale FROM (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month
) AS ranked_sales
WHERE rank = 1;
```

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Top 5 Customers by Total Sales**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9Ô∏è‚É£ **Unique Customers per Category**

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

üîü **Sales Distribution by Shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)**

```sql
WITH hourly_sales AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_sales
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```
